## Overview
In collaboration with ‘ĀinaQuest, I and three other teammates designed and developed a mobile app that aimed to foster a deeper connection with the natural world - specifically native Hawaiian plants - by turning the real-world act of identifying plants into a collectible plant-card experience.  Through scanning plants, users gain a collectible "plant-mon" card and earn points based on the plant's category (canoe, native, or invasive).  Canoe and native plants earned the user more points while invasive plants earned less.  A leaderboard system was incorporated to encourage ongoing participation and motivate users to explore their environment.

An additional AR component was developed and tested in Unity by me and a teammate that identified photos of plants and generated a corresponding 3D model that the user could move around the screen.  Because of time constraints, only a demo was completed and it was not integrated into the final product.
